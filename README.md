# ExtraWorlds (BETA & UNSTABLE)
This plugin is based off of [MultiWorlds](https://github.com/salasxd/multiworlds) by SalasCris and is heavily inspired by it. A lot of credit goes to him for the idea of this. This plugin is still in BETA stages but should have a first release soon. You might question what mine gives that MultiWorlds doesn't. The main thing is the ability to save the worlds properly, multiworlds sadly doesn't do this and can possibly currupt some of your worlds. Other things it adds/will add are:

游릭 Change world settings on creation

游릭 The ability to make Legacy/Infinite/Flat/Void worlds

游댮 World specific addons and packs

游댮 Transfer data accross worlds such as player data or other data

游댮 Disabled nether & end

游댮 The ability to make custom superflats

> 游댮 Won't be in first release

> 游릭 Will be in first release

# Commands
We won't have many commands since there's not much for commands, but here is a list of them anyway

## 游릭 /createworld
This one is pretty straight forward, it creates a world! Well more sends a form to you to setup the settings for a new world.
#### /createworld [worldName: string]
But wait! There's more! This one creates a default world with default settings and default addons/packs.

## 游릭 /transfer
This will pop up a form with a list of worlds! If you are a admin it will run the world, if clicked on, if it's not active! (will only work on the main world for the time being)
#### /transfer [worldName: string]
This skips the mess of a form and allows you to input a world name. Will not be case sensitive unless of course the is like a world called "New World" and another called "new world".

## 游릭 /worlds
An admin only command that allows you to start/stop/edit worlds

## 游댮 /world
Another admin only command that will provide most, if not, all world data you want.
